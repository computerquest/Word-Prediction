# word-prediction

This was my first major project. I wanted to create a word prediction program like the one on your phone and I started with developing the base technology in c++. I incorporated NGrams, Neural Networks, and my unresearched views on linguistics. I wrote all of my own code for NGrams and Neural Networks which worked. I had also started creating systems for detecting and learning new words. I parsed the text for input using my uniformed linguistic views which worked in a limited capacity. I got as far as training a network to learn part of speech when I realized that my mistakes in linguistics required a very substantial rewrite, so I ended the project.
